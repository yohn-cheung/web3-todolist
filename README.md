# Basic Web3 TodoList

This project demonstrates a basic Web3 todolist. It comes with a simple contract to create, update, delete and complete task. The frontend is build with Vue3 and bootstrap. I have mostly followed the tutorial of [Program with Erik](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBUMbdiI6Ug)
